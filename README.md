# react-native-media-editor

## Overview
This is a quick react-native example from a recent project. 
This iOS app allows you to place a song over the top of a video, trimming and positioning the song to exactly the spot you want.

## Native Modules
The full project included a module that actually generates a final MP4 with the changes so you can share to social media. Unfortunately, I didn't get permission to share that section of the code.

## Android
There is no reason why this wouldn't work on Android, although it hasn't been tested as the clients needs were purely for an iOS app.
